### About me
Hello there! I'm Charlotte, currently a computer science student studying at SUTD and taking an accelerated Masters with courses from Berkeley Extension. I've worked on projects in Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Android Studio before. I'm currently looking for an Internship in the Bay Area and am hoping to meet a passionate team. In my free time, I play around with making Instagram filters and crochet too!
