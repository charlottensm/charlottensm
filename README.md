### About me
Hello there! 

<!-- I'm Abram, a computer science undergraduate at SUTD. I have worked at LionsBot, a startup that designs and builds cleaning robots with personalities, at ST Electronics (Info-Security) doing some cyber-security work, and in Deloitte's cyber cloud team. I code in C++, Python, Java, Ruby and Swift and look forward to building the future of cloud computing, cool robots and applications that make our lives better! -->
